# Search Service

## Overview

The **Search Service** is a Spring Boot application that provides functionalities for searching various resources. It is built using Maven and follows best practices for modular design, security, and error handling. This 
service utilizes OAuth2 for secure access and includes robust error handling and logging.

## Features

- **Search functionality**: Perform searches across different resources.
- **OAuth2 Security**: Secured endpoints with JWT authentication.
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handling to manage errors gracefully.
- **Caching**: Utilizes Redis for caching frequently requested data.
- **Logging**: Structured logging for better debugging and monitoring.

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: Version 17
- **Spring Boot**: Version 3.3.4
- **Maven**: Build tool for dependency management
- **Spring Security**: For securing the application
- **Redis**: For caching
- **JUnit**: For unit testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.6.0 or later
- Redis server (if using caching)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KirtiUpacharya/project-central.git
   cd project-central/Search-service
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Set up your `application.properties` file:
   - Create a file named `application.properties` in `src/main/resources/` and configure it with your application settings, database connections, and any API keys.

### Running the Application

Run the application using Maven:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on the default port (8080). You can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- **Search Endpoint**:
  ```
  GET /api/v1/search?query={query}&page={page}&size={size}
  ```

### Security

This service uses OAuth2 for securing its endpoints. Make sure to acquire a valid JWT token and include it in the `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command:
```bash
mvn test
```
